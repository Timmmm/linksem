synopsis:
  "A formalisation of the core ELF and DWARF file formats written in Lem"
description: """
A formalisation of the core ELF and DWARF file format written in Lem.
ELF is the de facto standard executable and linkable file format
on Linux and related systems; DWARF is the associated debug information format.
This formalisation has been tested against approximately 5,000 ELF binaries
found \"in the wild\" on various different platforms.
